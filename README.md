- ⚡ Fun fact:Did you know that the term "bug" in programming actually originated from a real insect? In 1947,
 Grace Hopper, a computer scientist, found a moth stuck in one of the relays of the Harvard Mark II computer.
  She removed it and taped it into the logbook, labeling it as the "first actual case of bug being found".
Since then, the term "bug" has been widely used in programming to refer to any error or glitch in a computer program.
